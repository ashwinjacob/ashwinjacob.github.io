    <h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
    <p>NIL, though an undergraduate-level of understanding of mathematical proofs is assumed.</p>

    <h2>Evaluation Policy:</h2>
    <p>Assignments/quizzes (20%), Mid Semester Exam (40%), End Semester Exam (40%).</p>

    <h2>Attendance Policy:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular attendance is essential and expected. Those below 75% attendance will be given a <strong>W</strong> grade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Standard of Conduct:</h2>
    <p>Violations of academic integrity will be severely penalized. Each student is expected to adhere to high standards of ethical conduct, especially those related to cheating and plagiarism. Any submitted work <strong>MUST BE</strong> an individual effort. Any academic dishonesty will result in zero marks in the corresponding exam or evaluation and will be reported to the department council for record-keeping and permission to assign an <strong>F</strong> grade in the course. The department policy on academic integrity can be found at: <a href="http://minerva.nitc.ac.in/cse/sites/default/files/attachments/news/Academic-Integrity.pdf">http://minerva.nitc.ac.in/cse/sites/default/files/attachments/news/Academic-Integrity.pdf</a>.</p>
